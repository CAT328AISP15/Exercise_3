# Exercise_3


Building off of Exercise 2, intergrate a particle system to your code using an array list. This particle system could consist of one of your agents, or it could be something new. Consider how long the particles last, the creation of new particles, as well as when they appear (interactivity, key/mouse press, as well as time).

Taking things even further, intergate forces into your particle system. Are these forces applied to all the particles universally, or only upon certain paricles under particular conditions?
